# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify suspicious lumps as benign or malignant based on specific variables using machine learning models. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and contribute to the early detection and treatment planning for breast cancer patients.


## Methods & Models Used
We employed various machine learning models to classify the data, comparing their effectiveness before and after optimization:

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

## Key Findings
- Initially, the models showed the following accuracy: Logistic Regression (91.8%), SVM (91.8%), KNN (88.2%), and Random Forest (94.1%).
- After optimization, the accuracy improved significantly: Logistic Regression (98.4%), SVM (98.9%), KNN (95.9%), and Random Forest (99.1%).

## Visualization
We visualized the features and model performances using various techniques to provide insights into the data and the classification process.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in classifying breast cancer tumors. The Random Forest model, after optimization, showed the highest accuracy, making it a promising tool for breast cancer diagnosis.
